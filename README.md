# Project Title: Botium Toys Internal Security Audit

### Introduction
In this project, I conducted an internal security audit for Botium Toys, a small U.S. toy development and sales business experiencing rapid growth in its online presence. The objective was to assess the current security posture, identify potential risks, vulnerabilities, and compliance gaps, and provide recommendations to enhance security and compliance.

### My Role
Cybersecurity Analyst/Cybersecurity Auditor
 As the cybersecurity auditor, my role was to review the IT manager's audit scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Subsequently, I performed an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.

### My Task
Review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. 
Perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist. 

### Scenario (Based on a fictional company)
Botium Toys' IT department initiated an internal security audit due to concerns about business continuity, compliance, and the growing online market. The audit aimed to secure the company's infrastructure, mitigate potential threats, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations, such as those related to online payments and the European Union.

### Controls and Compliance Checklist:
I completed a controls and compliance checklist to assess Botium Toys' current state of security controls and compliance. Some highlights include:

 - Lack of "Least Privilege" and "Separation of Duties" controls.
 - Absence of disaster recovery plans and data backups.
 - Insufficient password policies and management.
 - A missing intrusion detection system (IDS).
 - Encryption gaps in credit card data handling.
 - Privacy and data protection policies compliant with GDPR for E.U. customers.
 - Recommendations provided for each control area.

### Results and Achievements
  - Identified high-risk areas, including inadequate asset management and non-compliance with regulations.
  - Scored the risk as 8 out of 10, signifying a fairly high risk.
  - Recommended specific control implementations and compliance best practices to enhance security and minimize risks.

### Challenges Faced
  - Highlight any difficulties or challenges encountered during the project, and how you overcame them. This demonstrates problem-solving skills.
  - Identifying potential security risks and compliance gaps.
  - Balancing security enhancements with business continuity requirements.

### Solutions Implemented
  - Reviewed existing audit materials and risk assessment reports.
  - Conducted an internal audit using a comprehensive controls and compliance checklist.
  - Analyzed the results to identify areas requiring improvements.

### Tools and Technologies Used
  - NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)
  - Audit scope and goals documentation
  - Risk assessment reports
  - Controls and compliance checklist
